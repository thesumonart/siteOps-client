/**
 * Response time over the selected window, one bar per bucket.
 *
 * Hand-drawn with divs rather than a charting library: this is a bar per
 * bucket with no axes, tooltips or interaction, and a charting dependency
 * would cost more in bundle size than the whole component.
 *
 * Colour follows the same vocabulary as the rest of the product: a period
 * where every check passed is normal, one where some passed is degraded, one
 * where none passed is down. Painting a period fully red because a single
 * check in it failed would contradict an uptime figure of 85% printed directly
 * above the chart.
 *
 * Buckets with no checks at all are absent from the data rather than drawn as
 * zero — a gap means "not measured", and an unmeasured hour must not look like
 * a failed one.
